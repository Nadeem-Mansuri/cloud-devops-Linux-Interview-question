why do we use provider in terrafrom.

Git.
How do you change the last commit?
Use `git commit --amend` to modify the most recent commit. This can change the commit's message or include new changes.

What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?
The main difference is in how the branch history is presented. 
`git merge` preserves the history of a feature branch by creating a new merge commit. 
`git rebase` rewrites the feature branch's history to appear as if it was developed from the latest main branch, creating a linear history.

What is `git checkout`?

What is the HEAD in Git? HEAD is a reference to the last commit in the currently checked-out branch.

How do you ignore changes in a tracked file?
Use `git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>` to ignore changes in a tracked file temporarily.

Task: Write Terraform code to provision an AWS EC2 instance in a specific region with the 
following specifications:

Instance Type: t2.micro
AMI: Only Latest AMI's of Ubuntu 20.04.
Availability Zone: Any
Security Group: Allow SSH access from anywhere (port 22)
Key Pair: Use an existing key pair named "my-key-pair"
Tags: Add a tag with the key "Name" and value "MyInstance"

========

Can you explain the scenario-based usage of the Terraform functions for_each and count? 
How are they different, and can you provide examples of when you might use each?

Flexibility and Change Management:

resource "aws_kms_key" "session_manager_kms_key" {
  count                   = local.create_kms_key ? 1 : 0
  description             = "KMS keys"
  deletion_window_in_days = 7
  policy                  = data.aws_iam_policy_document.kms_key_policy[0].json
}

1. Could you clarify the distinction between monolithic and microservices architectures.
2. could you provide more details about the specific monolithic architecture you have implemented? Lastly, have you migrated to a microservices architecture within the same project?
3. If you are working with a monolithic architecture, you typically store all the code in a single repository.
  However, if you are transitioning to a microservices architecture, will you continue to maintain the code in a single repository,
  or will you distribute it across multiple repositories? What would be the steps you follow in that scenario?
4. what is the difference between git merge and git-rebase
5.  Letâ€™s consider a scenario where you are working on code and have made multiple commits. Now, you want to make another commit, but you want it to use the same commit message as before and avoid creating a new commit message for each push.
6.  After making 10 commits, you decide that the 11th commit should not be added as a separate commit but instead merged into the previous commit. What would be the steps or commands required to accomplish this?
7. You are part of a team working on the same codebase, where you are adding and committing changes.
   However, you encounter a merge conflict in your branch. How would you handle and resolve this conflict,
   especially since another team member is also working on the same codebase?
7. which git workflow you are using in your current project.

3. what does mean by multi-branch branch pipeline? Why we are using it.
4. for any pipeline? And you want to integrate all the different tools with Jenkins. For example, you want to pick the code from Github right?
And then you want to build the code with the enable tool.
Let's take the meven itself. Okay? Then you need to scan that code with the some scanner tool. 
Then you want to create some image or something you need to deploy somewhere, right? But these tools, like Docker communities, or the Github,
or the the Memo itself, how you integrate with the Jenkins

7. Have you set up the Jenkins architecture? Have you? You used right, Jenkins? But you could like install Jenkins or you the slaves, or how the things like architecture means how many
 Jenkins ma master will be there. Notes will be there right? So which architecture you use like one genuine master, one node. How? How do architecture in your case?
 
8.  which plugins you have used for Jenkins.
9.  so how you design your pipeline? And what are the steps in the pipeline like? What kind of steps you have taken? I think you should you have written some pipeline for the github? 
Right? If you want to do some jobs in the through the pipeline itself? So what are the steps in that.
10. have you worked on any application based pipeline like Java.

Docker:-

1.  what kind of docker file you have created?
2. main difference between CMD and Entrypoint, can we use both CMD and Entrypoint in a single docker file.
