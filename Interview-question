why do we use provider in terrafrom.
Why do we provisioner.

Git.
How do you change the last commit?
Use `git commit --amend` to modify the most recent commit. This can change the commit's message or include new changes.

What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?
The main difference is in how the branch history is presented. 
`git merge` preserves the history of a feature branch by creating a new merge commit. 
`git rebase` rewrites the feature branch's history to appear as if it was developed from the latest main branch, creating a linear history.

What is `git checkout`?

What is the HEAD in Git? HEAD is a reference to the last commit in the currently checked-out branch.

How do you ignore changes in a tracked file?
Use `git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>` to ignore changes in a tracked file temporarily.

1. Could you clarify the distinction between monolithic and microservices architectures.
2. could you provide more details about the specific monolithic architecture you have implemented? Lastly, have you migrated to a microservices architecture within the same project?
3. If you are working with a monolithic architecture, you typically store all the code in a single repository.

  or will you distribute it across multiple repositories? What would be the steps you follow in that scenario?
4. what is the difference between git merge and git-rebase
5.  Letâ€™s consider a scenario where you are working on code and have made multiple commits. Now, you want to make another commit, but you want it to use the same commit message as before and avoid creating a new commit message for each push.
6.  After making 10 commits, you decide that the 11th commit should not be added as a separate commit but instead merged into the previous commit. What would be the steps or commands required to accomplish this?
7. You are part of a team working on the same codebase, where you are adding and committing changes.
   However, you encounter a merge conflict in your branch. How would you handle and resolve this conflict,

-----------------DEVOPS--------------
=================================================================================
1. How you can configure a kubernetes application to available outside world.?
   To make a Kubernetes application available to the outside world, you need to expose the application's service
   outside the cluster. Kubernetes provides multiple mechanisms to expose an application, such as using NodePort,
   LoadBalancer, or Ingress.

2. There is an high latency expericing in RDS instance, How you can resolve it.?
	To resolve high write latency in RDS:

		Analyze metrics using CloudWatch (identify CPU, I/O, memory, and connection bottlenecks).
		Optimize slow queries and reduce locking contention.
		Improve storage performance by using Provisioned IOPS and increasing storage capacity.
		Scale up the instance class for better resources (CPU and memory).
		Use read replicas to offload read traffic.
		Adjust database engine parameters, such as transaction handling and caching.
		Ensure proper application-level optimizations, such as connection pooling and batch operations.
		
These steps should help mitigate the write latency issues. If you're still experiencing issues,
consider testing your workload on Amazon Aurora where write scaling may be more efficient for high-write applications.

3. How to increase IOPS in RDS.

4. If you change instance type in RDS, is there any downtime.
Changes That Typically Cause Downtime
These types of changes require the database instance to reboot, which results in downtime. During the reboot, connectivity to the instance will be interrupted.

	1. Scaling Instance Class
	Changing the instance type/class (e.g., upgrading from db.t2.micro to db.m5.large).
	Downtime: Yes, a reboot is required, and downtime will occur while the database instance switches to the new class.
	How to Minimize Downtime: You can schedule the change during the preferred maintenance window to avoid disrupting live applications:
bash


aws rds modify-db-instance \
  --db-instance-identifier <your-db-instance> \
  --db-instance-class <new-instance-class> \
  --no-apply-immediately

By using --no-apply-immediately, the change will be applied during the maintenance window rather than immediately.

2. Storage Type Changes
Changing the storage type (e.g., switching from gp2 to io1/io2 or gp3).
Downtime: Yes, as this may involve stopping the instance temporarily to migrate the storage.
How to Minimize Downtime: Apply changes during the maintenance window.

3. Enabling Multi-AZ Deployment
Enabling Multi-AZ requires setting up a secondary replica in another availability zone.
Downtime: Yes, a brief service disruption occurs when enabling Multi-AZ.
How to Minimize Downtime: Perform this change during the maintenance window.

4. Parameter Group Changes
If modifying parameters requires a reboot, such as changing instance-level kernel settings or database engine configuration (e.g., innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit, max_connections on MySQL or PostgreSQL).
Downtime: Reboot required for certain parameter modifications.
How to Minimize Downtime: Schedule the reboot during the maintenance window.

5. Switch to Dedicated Network or Encryption Changes
Switching to a new VPC/subnet group or enabling encryption on storage.
Downtime: Yes, changes require migration or reboot.
How to Minimize Downtime: Perform these operations outside peak hours or during the maintenance window.

Changes That Typically Do NOT Cause Downtime:-
	1. Increasing Storage Size - Increasing allocated storage does not cause downtime.
	2. Updating Instance Tags - Modifying tags to label or organize instances does not affect services.
	3. Adding or Modifying Read Replicas - Adding read replicas or modifying existing replicas does not affect the primary instance.
	4. Performance Features - Changing IOPS values for io1/io2 or switching from gp2 to gp3 does not cause downtime as long as apply-immediately is used.
	5. Monitoring or Logging Features - Turning on options like Enhanced Monitoring, Performance Insights, or Log Exports typically does not cause downtime.
	
6. DR Strategies in AWS	
	1.Backup & Restore: Lowest cost (pay only for backup storage until you restore).
	2.Pilot Light: Moderate cost (resources used minimally).
	3.Warm Standby: Higher cost (scaled-down environments remain operational).
	4.Multi-Site Active/Active: Highest cost ($$$) due to resource duplication across regions.
	
7. When you make DNS changes in Amazon Route 53, how much time it will take for propagation.
	1. Key Factors Affecting Propagation Time-
	What is TTL?
		TTL specifies how long DNS resolvers (e.g., ISPs and caching servers) cache a DNS record before checking for an update.
		Each DNS record in Route 53 has a TTL value in seconds. For example, if the TTL is 300 seconds (5 minutes), DNS resolvers will use the cached value for 5 minutes before querying Route 53 for the latest record.
		
		What happens if TTL is high?
		If the TTL is long (e.g., 24 hours = 86,400 seconds), resolvers may continue to use the outdated IP address or value until the TTL expires.
		
		What happens if TTL is low?
		Setting a shorter TTL (e.g., 60 seconds) reduces propagation time because resolvers check for changes more frequently.
		
8. How you can implement CICD for Kubernetes. 
	1. Set Up the Kubernetes Cluster
	2. Set Up a Version Control System (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
	3. Automate the Build Process in CI/CD Tool
	4. Push the Docker Image to a Container Registry
	5. Update Kubernetes Manifests
	6.  Deploy to Kubernetes
		
	7. Set Up CI/CD Pipelines using Gitlab or Github action
	8. GitOps for Kubernetes using ArgoCD
	9. Monitor and Automate Rollbacks
	
9. Suppose If your existing Amazon EKS Cluster is configured to use a single Availability Zone (AZ) 
	with a managed node group, how you can add a new node group in a different AZ in the existing cluster.
	1. Identify Available AZs in the Region: Check the available AZs for your region:
	2. Create a New Subnet in the Desired AZ: Choose an AZ that is different from the one where your existing node group resides.
	3. Ensure the Subnet Has a Route to the Internet (if required):
	4. Modify Subnet Tags for EKS (Optional):
	5. Associate the New Subnet with the EKS Cluster
	6. Create a New Managed Node Group in the New AZ
	
	
10. How to extend volume if it is filled up.
    	1. lsblk
	2. sudo growpart /dev/nvme0n1 1 (for XFS filesystem)
	3. sudo xfs_growfs -d /  (for XFS filesystem)
	4. resize2fs /dev/nvme0n1p1 (For ext4 filesystem)
